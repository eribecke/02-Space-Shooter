# 02 Space Shooter
2/11/13

This is my second project for my Game Technology Course. 

Enjoy this vibrantly colored arcade space shooter as you
zoom through space, blast through asteroids, and face a fearsome enemy.


## Implementation
All of the code for this project was implemented using GDScript in Godot.
I created my own art using Procreate on my IPad and imported it into the game.

## References
Inspired by classic arcade space shooter games. 
For my in-game font I used Indie Flower by Kimberly Geswein (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower?query=indie+)

## Future Development
If I were to work on this project in the future, I would like to make it more exploratory by having the camera focus on the player and creating a more structured game map. I would also like to add some customization options, such as different ship models and colors. Lastly, I would like to add upon the enemy by giving it different motion paths and possibly different types of attacks so that it is more like a boss battle.
